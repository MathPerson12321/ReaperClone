# When Reaper
Who will steal the time?

A game inspired by Art of Problem Solving's Reaper, where you reap to get time, but the stopwatch resets after each reap. You have to get a certain goal time to win the game, but there are cooldowns between reaps, and bonuses stand in your way.

Bonuses are for example, multipliers, and the rest are secret until you play the game. Some bonuses are self implemented, and some requested by the community, with some extra features as well.

This game will diss you as well for your reaps, so thats a skill issue.
